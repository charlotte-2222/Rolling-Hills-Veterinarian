# CPT-206 Final Project | Rolling Hills Vet Services Application
## This application is intended to be a desktop application used by staff at your local veterinarian hospital.

I first decided on this idea due to the constant emergency visits to my local vet for my new dog Cocoa bean,
who is a rather troublesome Chihuahua that enjoys scaring me by licking bug poison strips in the middle of the night,
or otherwise having terrible allergy reactions to a variety of things.

This app will:

	- Allow the technician to login based on data in the database
	- Let that techician add new owners/pet accounts to the database
	- Make appointments for owners based on need, with preferred staff and by preffered contact method
	- Will allow the technician to email that owner (Yes, this really works! That email is real!)
	- Will allow the technician to print off an internal appointment sheet for the technicians and doctors
		to have for the upcoming appointment.

	Additionally there is an admin module that will allow the administrator to modify the staff table in certain, yet thoughtful ways.


All in all - this is simple yet complete "Front Desk" style application that enables it's users to effortlessly sign-in
and begin operations for the day.
